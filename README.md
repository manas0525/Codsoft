I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed a one-month virtual internship as a Web Development at CodSoft!

This short but intensive experience was a fantastic opportunity to apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects. I'm grateful for the hands-on learning and the chance to challenge myself.

The projects were a fantastic journey in applying the skills I've been learning in web development. It challenged me to bring my personal projects together into a single place and showcase my work.

This internship has sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and reinforced the importance of problem-solving.

Thank you, CodSoft, for this valuable and well-structured learning experience. I'm excited to leverage these new skills in my future projects and career.
